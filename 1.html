<h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
<h4><P style="color:black">Anna University, established on September 4, 1978, by the Government of Tamil Nadu, emerged through the integration of four prestigious institutions in Chennai: the College of Engineering, Guindy (CEG), the Alagappa College of Technology (ACT), the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT), and the School of Architecture and Planning (SAP). Named after C.N. Annadurai, a revered former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, the university initially operated as a unitary type of institution. Over time, it expanded its programs and began affiliating engineering colleges across Tamil Nadu, significantly increasing its influence. In 2001, it transitioned into an affiliating university, further broadening its reach. The university experienced a split in 2007 into six universities, only to be reunited in 2010, reaffirming its status as a single, cohesive entity. Known for its robust academic programs, research initiatives, and industry collaborations, Anna University celebrated its silver jubilee in 2003. It continues to uphold its legacy of excellence in engineering and technology education, contributing significantly to the development of skilled professionals in India.</P></h4>
